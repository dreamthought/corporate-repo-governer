# Repository Name Governor Microservice

## Raf's DISCLAIMER
* Think of this entire project as mono-repo of interdepenecies.
* I'd usually use a git-subtree but this is to avoid confusion on the part of the Partner's developer when viewing the
conceptual solution
* The NameChangeEvent had been intended to contain more data to aid in creating a meanginful issue. I've reduced it to a 
single property which violates DRY at the design level since it is also part of the path
